# Flan-T5-Description-Generator
A description would be generator from structure textual data. The data source is stored in the form of Dictionary in Python language.
In fact, in this project the code relies on images and more specifically the focus is on images of traffic, passengers, pedestrians etc.
Since generating a comprehensive description from an image is a different task, this part would be implemented in a different project instead and the textual feature-based data would be used to be fed into the main model.
